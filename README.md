# Loan Default


## Instruction

Assuming you are working in a bank and a customer is requesting for loan. You need to predict if the customer will default the loan. You are to create the predictive model using machine learning model.

Please use all the attibutes except the index. Remember to split train test using default rates. use dummy variables for Employed.

Split before normalize and oversample the minoritty. Normalize annual salary and Bank Balance using zscore.

All machine learning use default setting. 
Measurement is accuracy.
Random state is 1 (need to use in train test split and model creation).
Data visualization is needed. At least use one of pandas, seaborn and matplotlib.


## Result & Requirements

The accuracy on test set should be regression 0.6024, Decision Tree 0.7148,Random Forest 0.6692, GBoost 0.606, NN 0.5992
You are required to plot ROC, precision_recall_curve

How to improve the results by change the features selected, data wrangling or parameter setting, ncluding using keras and tensorflow.

Qualitatively, explain the pros and cons about your model
